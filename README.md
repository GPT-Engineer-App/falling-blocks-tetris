Tetris

A game where the computer provides a random block shape to the player. The player must rotate and drop the block into place. When there is a full row of blocks filled, that row disappears and the user gets points. Every x seconds, the blocks move up by 1 row to increase the difficultly. At the beginning, that movement is slow. The longer the player plays for, the faster it goes.
